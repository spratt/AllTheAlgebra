\chapter{Monoids}

A \emph{binary operation} is a mapping from $A \cross B$ to $ C $.

A binary operation is said to be \emph{closed} if it maps from $A
\cross A$ to $A$.

A closed binary operation ( $ \dot $ ) is said to be
\emph{associative} if $ \forall a,b,c \in A: ( a \dot b ) \dot c = a
\dot ( b \dot c )$.

A \emph{monoid} is a 3-tuple $(\dot, M, e)$ where $\dot$ is an
associative, closed binary operation on $M$ and $ e \in M: \forall m
\in M: e \dot m = m $.

\section{Row Monomials}

We define the \emph{row monomials}, $RM(n)$, as the set of all $0,1$
matrices with exactly one $1$ per row.  We will show that
$(\dot,RM(n),I_n)$ forms a monoid, where $\dot$ is matrix
multiplication, and $I_n$ is the identity for $n \cross n$ matrices.
Since matrix multiplication is associative in general, we need only
prove the following claim:

\begin{claim}

  $RM(n)$ is closed under matrix multiplication.

\end{claim}

\begin{proof}

  Let $A,B \in RM(n)$.  $A$ is composed of the elements $a_{ij}$.  For
  all $1 \leq i \leq n$ there exists a unique $l$ such that $a_{il} =
  1$ and for all $j \neq l$, $a_{ij} = 0$.

  \[
  (AB)_{ij} = \summ{k=1}{n} a_{ik}b_{kj} = a_{il}b_{lj} = b_{lj}
  \]

  \[
  \therefore (AB)_{ij} \in RM(n)
  \]
  
\end{proof}

Thus proving $RM(n)$ is a monoid.
