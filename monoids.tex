\chapter{Monoids}

A \emph{binary operation} is a mapping from $A \cross B$ to $ C $.

A binary operation is said to be \emph{closed} if it maps from $A
\cross A$ to $A$.

A closed binary operation ( $ \dot $ ) is said to be
\emph{associative} if $ \forall a,b,c \in A: ( a \dot b ) \dot c = a
\dot ( b \dot c )$.

A \emph{monoid} is a 3-tuple $(\dot, M, e)$ where $\dot$ is an
associative, closed binary operation on $M$ and $ e \in M: \forall m
\in M: e \dot m = m $.
