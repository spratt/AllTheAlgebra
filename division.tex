\section{The Extended Euclidean Algorithm}

Given numbers $a,b$ with which we would like to calculate $gcd(a,b)$,
we can do so using the Euclidean Algorithm.  Without loss of
generality, say $ a > b $.  Let $r_0 = a, r_1 = b$.  We divide
$r_{i-2},r_{i-1}$ to give us $r_{i-2} = r_{i-1} \times q_i + r_i$.  We
continue dividing until we find a $k$ such that $r_k = 0$.

The ``extension'' of the Euclidean Algorithm also gives us $s_i, t_i$
such that $ b \times r_i = b \times s_i + a \times t_i $.  This is
important for \emph{RSA Encryption}.
